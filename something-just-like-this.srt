1
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:10,314
I have been reading books of old

2
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:12,607
The legends and the myths

3
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,008
Achilles and his gold

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,399
Hercules and his gifts

5
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:19,604
Spiderman′s control

6
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,703
And Batman with his fists

7
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:26,100
And clearly I don′t see
myself upon that list

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,007
She said Where′d you wanna go?

9
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:31,014
How much you wanna risk?

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,399
I am not looking for somebody

11
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,810
With some superhuman gifts

12
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,215
Some superhero

13
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,500
Some fairytale bliss

14
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,911
Just something I can turn to

15
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,112
Somebody I can kiss

16
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,607
I want something just like this

17
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,898
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

18
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,207
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo

19
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:54,154
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

20
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:56,911
Oh I want something just like this

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,214
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

22
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,517
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo

23
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,500
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

24

I have been reading books of old

27
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:27,216
The legends and the myths

28
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,617
The testaments they told

29
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,900
The moon and it is eclipse

30
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,107
And Superman unrolls

31
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,110
A suit before he lifts

32
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:40,907
But I am not the kind of
person that it fit is

33
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:43,502
She said Where′d you wanna go?

34
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,515
How much you wanna risk?

35

Some fairytale bliss

39
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:57,404
Just something I can turn to

40
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,413
Somebody I can miss

41
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:02,608
